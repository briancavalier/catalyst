Try the examples:

* [mouse-position](https://cdn.rawgit.com/briancavalier/catalyst/master/examples/mouse-position/index.html) - simple mouse position tracking
* [add-inputs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/briancavalier/catalyst/master/examples/add-inputs/index.html) - add the current value of two inputs
* [counters](https://cdn.rawgit.com/briancavalier/catalyst/master/examples/counters/index.html) - control multiple stateful counters, with localstorage persistence
* [bounce](https://cdn.rawgit.com/briancavalier/catalyst/master/examples/bounce/index.html) - hundreds of bouncing balls, with interactive speed control

Or you can run them locally after cloning the repo:
